# Blade Surface Defect Detection with Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting **surface defects on turbine blades** such as **nicks** and **scratches** using **Machine Learning** and **Transfer Learning** techniques. Early detection of these defects is critical to maintain efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and improve the safety of turbine systems.

## üìå Project Overview

Turbine blades operate at high speeds and play a crucial role in energy production. Over time, defects like scratches, nicks, or cracks may occur.

- These defects reduce aerodynamic efficiency and can cause energy loss.
- If left untreated, they may lead to blade breakage, resulting in downtime and safety risks.
- **Automatic defect detection** using ML ensures continuous monitoring and more reliable results compared to manual inspections.
